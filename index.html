            <p class="text">Dear Bursary team,</p>
            <div class="paragraphs">
                <p class="text">
                    I am writing this motivation to aid my application for admission into your bursary program to help fund my studies for 2025 and beyond. I have been readmitted into the University of Cape Town to pursue a BSc in Computer Science & Applied Mathematics. Given my academic record and determination for excellence, I believe I am the ideal candidate to invest in. 
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    I attended Northriding Secondary School, where I maintained a solid grade average for the majority of my high school career. I consistently ranked within the top 10 learners for each of my subjects during my senior years and was regularly recognised for my academic excellence. I previously attended UCT in 2023 and completed my first year. There too, I achieved a decent 72% average, netting me a spot on the Dean’s merit list. Unfortunately, my studies were cut short due to lack of funding. 
        
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    I intend to use my degree to pursue a career in finance/tech, and am interested in roles in Full Stack Development, Mathematical modelling, and Data Science. I plan on taking additional statistics courses in order to build a solid knowledge base for these positions. I want a job that leverages my innate knack for mathematical problem solving, thus the motivation for my major selection. The Applied Math major gives exposure to fundamental topics like linear algebra, calculus, real analysis, and modelling which have application in finance and engineering, among other fields. The major cultivates critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I have found it to be a better fit for my goals than the Computer Engineering major which I was previously enrolled for, hence my decision to change it in preparation for my return to university. Computer Science is a no-brainer, as I’ve always had an interest in software, and I am keen on picking up from where I left off. I seek to use the bursary and my degree not only to advance my own career but also to uplift my family by financially contributing to a tertiary education for my younger sister.

                <p class="text">
                    If it weren’t for my circumstances, and the importance of securing a job promptly after graduation, and also considering my interest in academia, I would definitely pursue post-graduate education in Artificial Intelligence, to eventually contribute to research. The potential for AI is overwhelmingly expansive given that the technology continues to improve at its pace. Every human problem that has been impossible or too challenging to solve due to our cognitive limitations could be offloaded to AI to hack away. Its sort of like the advent of the calculator, enabling us to abstract away the grunt work which poses as a bottleneck for innovation, freeing us with the mental bandwidth to focus on ideas generation and higher-level problem solving. I’m more excited for its application in science problems, behaving like an advanced research assistant to help us arrive to existential breakthroughs that benefit humanity. Machine learning models can be applied to medicine for example, modelling millions of combinations of chemicals and genetic sequences every day to work towards cures for diseases, self-correcting its model each time it fails to come up with better solutions for subsequent iterations. There are already startups employing this kind of thing today. And I am only barely scratching the surface.

                    Given that my parents earn middle class incomes, my first year in 2023 had to be funded with a study loan from the bank, as I was unable to qualify for NSFAS. Unfortunately, I could not secure funding for subsequent years after first year, as we would be unable to afford additional years on the loan, not to mention the rejections from the bursaries that I applied for, where you compete against strong competition over very limited spots. As a consequence, I was forced to hit pause on my studies. But that’s life, and every stumble sharpens the path forward. I have used the gap year to gain work experience, obtain my learner’s licence, and have continued to nurture the programming skills that were instilled within me from first year by taking online courses on web development, with the intention to hopefully return to school in 2025 to further my fundamental concepts. Considering the upward social and financial mobility that a university degree catalyses, as well as coming from a household where no one holds a degree, it is imperative that I pursue one; to ensure that in my generation, there is some improvement in our standards of living. 
        
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    I respectfully urge that my application be considered based on merit and potential rather than solely on social circumstances. Although my household income may slightly exceed the usual income cap for bursaries, it does not reflect the financial realities we face. There seems to be a disconnect between the assumed financial flexibility of households above the threshold and the actual limitations experienced. The assumption that families just above the limit are better off overlooks the similarities in the challenges they face with those at or below the figure. This threshold does not account for the rising cost of living, hence the inability to afford university expenses. I understand that a bursary would want to prioritise more disadvantaged candidates in order to level the playing field, but this requirement alienates individuals like myself who also have a desire to further their academic qualifications and actually show dedication to it, considering that the pursuit of a degree opens access to professions that demand advanced problem-solving skills, playing a crucial role in sustaining and advancing the economy. My academic achievements and career aspirations demonstrate my commitment to making the most of this opportunity, which means everything to me.

                <p class="last-par text">
                    I strongly believe that I deserve this opportunity. My track record is clear and my ambitions are high. Investing in an individual like myself ensures that South Africa continues to be enriched by working professionals contributing to the economy. Additionally, I believe that the trials and tribulations I have faced have given me a perspective that has positively poured onto my work ethic, and will continue to do so. The resultant maturity I have garnered is exactly the kind of quality in an applicant that your program needs. I have begun to embody a philosophy that promotes relentless hard work as the recipe for success, hence my dedication to write a solid motivation. This level of grit is the determining factor that individuals like myself, those not born into privilege and an abundance of opportunities, must leverage in order to set themselves apart to change their circumstances. And the consequence is simply that if you don’t work hard, you won’t achieve success, so I have no other option. You literally need to outwork everybody and produce an output that exceeds the level that is expected, and you owe it to yourself to do so. I wish I had realised this sooner. With this in consideration, I want to take on more leadership positions at university as class reps for my courses, as well as and participate in more events like career fairs and conferences to learn more outside of the lecture room. The opportunity to return to university and complete my studies ensures that I can continue to evolve intellectually, as well as improve my future professional opportunities through cultivating a robust network, and eventually show my value in the workplace and beyond.
